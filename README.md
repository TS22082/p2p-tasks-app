# p2p lyfe :)
A persistent storage p2p app that uses the beaker browser and dat protocol to allow users to connect to the app, create a task list, and add items to the task list. Each task list is assigned a shareable dat address. 

# Notes
I think one of the greatest benifits of the beaker browser and dat is that the 2 together let me (the developer) provide something purily for the user. In a cloud storage system I'de eventually have to monetize a project to pay for storage, in a p2p model thats unnessecary because Im not storing their data, they (the user) stores their data.
